## Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts whether hotel customers will cancel their reservations based on historical booking data. Using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying potential cancellations, helping hotels optimize their operations and revenue management strategies.
Business Context
Hotel reservation cancellations can significantly impact revenue and resource planning. This project provides a data-driven solution to:

- Reduce Revenue Loss: Predict cancellations to enable proactive overbooking strategies
- Identify Fraudulent Behavior: Detect customers who repeatedly make and cancel bookings
- Enable Targeted Marketing: Focus retention efforts on customers with high cancellation probability

## Dataset
The project uses the Hotel Reservations Classification Dataset from Kaggle, which includes booking information and whether the reservation was ultimately canceled.
